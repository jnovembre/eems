## Documentation about EEMS

* `SMBE2015-slides`: the slides for a talk about EEMS presented at SMBE 2015
* `SMBE2015-slides-comments`: the slides with comments for each slide
* `EEMS-article`: the article which describes EEMS. The preprint is also on [bioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/11/26/011809).
* `EEMS-suppinfo`: the supplementary information
* `EEMS-doc`: the instruction manual
* `EEMS-sims`: a note which describes how to use `ms` to simulate geo-referenced data under three demographic scenarios that produce an effective barrier to migration but for different reasons:
	* scenario with reduced migration rates
	* scenario with reduced effective population sizes
	* scenario with a split in the past (complete vicariance)
* `bed2diffs-doc`: a note about bed2diffs. This is a small program to compute the matrix of pairwise genetic dissimilarities from a PLINK binary BED file.
